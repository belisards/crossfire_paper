## Introduction

The research implemented and evaluated the use of a language model by human rights analysts to crowdsource gun violence reports using online data. 

Our main contributions are the following:

Real-world evaluation with measurable impact

## The needle in the haystack

Online data is a promising resource for human rights monitoring (REF), but organizations struggle with:

**Scale mismatch** - Massive data vs. limited human resources

**Real-time needs** - Violence requires immediate response

Discovering critical online evidence often seems like searching for a needle in the haystack.

## Fogo Cruzado

Fogo Cruzado is a Brazilian organization that represents these challenges.

- Monitors events of gun violence in Brazil

- Small team of analysts monitoring 24/7

- Manual social networks monitoring

## Tracking tweets with Tweetdeck...

Column-based interface with restricted location filters.

## Research question

**RQ1** - Can Transformer-based language models accurately identify gun violence reports in Brazilian Portuguese social media texts?

**RQ2** - What are the advantages and challenges of adopting a language model for real-time monitoring compared to manually reviewing social media texts?

---

## Methodology (RQ1)

We trained a BERT model with Twitter data using past interactions from the organization

## Methodology (RQ2)

Experiment

## Tracking with tweets with our interface...

We used Airtable to implement the protoype. The interface shows a dedicated tab for tweets classified as gun violence reports.

## Key Findings (RQ1)

AI models can filter out less relevant social media content and provides a higher signal-to-noise input for analysts. 

Instead of using restrictive geolocation filters that limit the number of messages when collecting data, our prototype allows analysts to expand their search scope

Reviewing messages pre-classified by the language model reduces the cognitive effort required to identify events.

## Key Findings (RQ2)

Interviews

## Key Findings (RQ2)

Updating new tweets promptly is critical for monitoring ongoing conflicts

Search keywords need to be dynamically set.

Further information beyond texts can help analysts interact with users

## Conclusion

Post-APIs: challenges for human rights monitoring
