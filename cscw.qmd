## {.center}

We deployed an **open source language model** to assist crowdsourcing gun violence events with social media.

Partnering with a Brazilian organization allowed us to **systematicaly evaluate** its application in a real-world setting in 2023.

## Background

Previous studies had explored machine learning models for human rights monitoring [Alhelbawy et al. (2020); Pilankar et al. (2022); Ta et al. (2022)].

However, there was a gap in the literature on applications in Portuguese and the evaluation of these models in a real-world setting and applications.

## The needle in the haystack

Crowdsourcing social media is a promising method for human rights monitoring, but...

Fogo Cruzado ([https://fogocruzado.org.br](fogocruzado.org.br)) monitors events of gun violence in Brazi. 

Small team of analysts track social media posts 24/7.

They've been interacting with users reporting gun violence on Twitter/X for years.

# Question and methods

**RQ1** - Can Transformer-based language models accurately identify gun violence reports in Brazilian Portuguese social media texts?

**RQ2** - What are the advantages and challenges of adopting a language model for real-time monitoring compared to manually reviewing social media texts?

:::: {.column width="50%"}
**RQ1:** Models trained on past analysts' interactions with tweets reporting gun violence.

**RQ2:** Surveys, interviews and metrics analyzed before and after the adoption of our prototype

# Findings

---

## Small and open source

A BERT-based model in Portuguese achieved good performance. Inference can be done in CPUs.

## Better signal-to-noise ratio

Interview with an analyst:

‚Äú[Now] I do not have to go hunting for tweets.

Sometimes, I missed them [gun violence reports] because there were too many [unrelated] messages. During the BBB [Big Brother Brasil, an annual TV show extremely popular on
Twitter], it was chaotic [. . . ]. It was literally a treasure hunt‚Äù

## Fewer filters, greater search scope

Instead of using restrictive geolocation filters that limit the number of messages when collecting data, our prototype allows analysts to expand their search scope.

## Limitations

::: {.incremental}

Updating new tweets promptly is critical for monitoring ongoing conflicts.

Search keywords need to be dynamically set.

Images help analysts interact with users.

Small and open source models are still useful.

Human rights monitoring: Academics ü§ù NGOs

The closure of social media APIs as a major obstacle for low-resourced organizations.
