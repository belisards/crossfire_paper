# The challenge

---

## The needle in the haystack

Social media is a valuable source for crowdsourcing evidence in human rights monitoring and investigations, but...

- Keyword-based search leads to a high proportion of unrelated text

- Small teams can't process high volumes of data

---

## What's been tried

Machine learning models show promise (Alhelbawy et al., 2020; Pilankar et al., 2022), but gaps remain:

- Few real-world evaluations 

- Unknown impact on workflows

- No previous work with Portuguese texts

# Our work 

---

We deployed an **open-source language model** to assist crowdsourcing gun violence events with social media.

Partnering with a Brazilian organization allowed us to **systematically evaluate** its application in a real-world setting in 2023.

---

![](../figs/fogocruzado.png){.center}

Fogo Cruzado ("Crossfire") monitors events of gun violence in four Brazilian cities. 

A small team of analysts track social media posts 24/7.

They have been interacting with users who report gun violence on Twitter/X for years.

Keyword-based search with geographical filters on Tweetdeck.

# Questions and methods

**RQ1** - Can Transformer-based language models accurately identify gun violence reports in Brazilian Portuguese social media texts?

**RQ2** - What are the advantages and challenges of adopting a language model for real-time monitoring compared to manually reviewing social media texts?

---

**RQ1: Model development**
Fine-tuned a BERT-based model on Portuguese tweets using past analyst interactions as training data.

**RQ2: Real-world deployment**
We built a visual interface to help analysts navigate the model‚Äôs predictions and conducted an evaluation of its adoption using mixed methods, including surveys, interviews, and interaction metrics analyzed (diff-in-diff model).

# Findings

---

## Small and open source

A BERT-based model in Portuguese achieved good performance. Inference can be performed on CPUs.

---

## The prototype

![](../figs/airtable.png)

Tweets were updated every fifteen minutes.

## Signal-to-noise ratio

The prototype effectively filtered out less relevant social media content.

### Interview with an analyst

‚Äú*[Now] I do not have to go hunting for tweets*.

*Sometimes, I missed them [gun violence reports] because there were too many [unrelated] messages. During the BBB [Big Brother Brasil, an annual TV show extremely popular on Twitter], it was chaotic [. . . ]. It was literally a treasure hunt*‚Äù
:::

## Fewer filters, greater scope

Our prototype removed the need for restrictive geolocation filters, allowing analysts to expand their search scope.

We estimated that analysts using the model engaged in nine additional daily interactions with users reporting events.

## Limitations

The interviews and surveys allowed us to identify three major shortcomings:

::: {.incremental}
- **The delay between each update**: promptly updating new tweets is critical.

- **Static keywords used for search**: terms need to be dynamically set to monitore live conflicts.

- **Use of text-only features**: profile images also help analysts to decide if they will interact with users.

# Takeaways for CSCW

ü§ù **AI and small language models can amplify crowdsourcing**, not replace human judgment

üìä **Real-world evaluation matters**: lab performance ‚â† practical impact

‚ö†Ô∏è **Platform dependencies are fragile**: closure of API access is critical
