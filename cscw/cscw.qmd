# The challenge {.fit-text}

---

Using AI with crowdsourced social media data is a promising resource for human rights monitoring [Alhelbawy et al. (2020)], but... 

::: {.incremental}

- Keyword-based search leads to high proportion of unrelated text.

- Organizations have limited resources to deal with massive data.

::: 

## Our work 

We deployed an **open source language model** to assist crowdsourcing gun violence events with social media.

Partnering with a Brazilian organization allowed us to **systematicaly evaluate** its application in a real-world setting in 2023.

## Background

Previous studies had explored machine learning models for human rights monitoring [Alhelbawy et al. (2020); Pilankar et al. (2022); Ta et al. (2022)].

However, there was a gap in the literature on applications in Portuguese and the evaluation of these models in a real-world setting and applications.

# Fogo Cruzado

Fogo Cruzado ([https://fogocruzado.org.br](fogocruzado.org.br)) monitors events of gun violence in Brazil. 

Small team of analysts track social media posts 24/7.

They've been interacting with users reporting gun violence on Twitter/X for years.

## Keyword-based search on Tweetdeck

# Questions and methods
::: {.incremental}

**RQ1** - Can Transformer-based language models accurately identify gun violence reports in Brazilian Portuguese social media texts?

**RQ2** - What are the advantages and challenges of adopting a language model for real-time monitoring compared to manually reviewing social media texts?

:::

**RQ1:** Models trained on past analysts' interactions with tweets reporting gun violence.

**RQ2:** Surveys, interviews and metrics analyzed before and after the adoption of our prototype

# Findings

---

## Small and open source

A BERT-based model in Portuguese achieved good performance. Inference can be done in CPUs.

## Our interface

## Better signal-to-noise ratio

Interview with an analyst:

‚Äú[Now] I do not have to go hunting for tweets.

Sometimes, I missed them [gun violence reports] because there were too many [unrelated] messages. During the BBB [Big Brother Brasil, an annual TV show extremely popular on Twitter], it was chaotic [. . . ]. It was literally a treasure hunt‚Äù

## Fewer filters, greater scope

Instead of using restrictive geolocation filters that limit the number of messages when collecting data, our prototype allows analysts to expand their search scope.

With a diff-in-diff model, we estimated that analysts using the model had nine additional daily interactions with gun violence reports.

## Limitations

::: {.incremental}

Updating new tweets promptly is critical for monitoring ongoing conflicts.

Search keywords need to be dynamically set.

Images help analysts interact with users.

# Two years later, final words

LLMs might be powerful, but small and open source models are still useful.

Human rights monitoring: Academics ü§ù NGOs

The closure of social media APIs as a major obstacle for low-resourced organizations.
